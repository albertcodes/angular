## Starting Point for Developing Angular Apps

### Running the Project
1) Open a command prompt in the project's root directory

2) Type: `npm install`
    This installs the dependencies as defined in the package.json file.

3) Type: `npm start`
    This launches the TypeScript compiler (tsc) to compile the application and wait for changes. It also starts the lite-server and launches the browser to run the application.
